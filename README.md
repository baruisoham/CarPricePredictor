# CarPricePredictor
Predicts Price of a Car based on different metrics

known issues, the logic and the prediction works, but the GUI does not work
`application.py` is based on flask -> gives internel server error when trying to fetch the predicted value
`app.py` uses streamlit -> gives  `Error during prediction: 'str' object has no attribute 'transform' `
